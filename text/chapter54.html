      <h1 class="page-title">Chapter LIV.<br> HOW THE HORN WAS GIVEN INTO YWAIN'S HAND, AND HOW HE SOUNDED THEREON A MORT ROYAL.</h1>
      <p>AND when it began to lighten towards dawn, then they went forth out of the house and made to go by the way of the market-place. And the snow had ceased from falling and it lay upon the ground before them deep and white, for it was yet untrodden. So they drew their cloaks about their faces and went quickly, to the intent that they should be known of none: and at the first there was no living soul that met with them. But afterward they had sight of three or four which came towards them, and by seeming they were the servants of some great one, accompanying with their master homeward.</p>

<p>And Ywain saw the lord of those men coming behind them, and he knew him well, for all that he was enwrapped against the cold. And they drew near to pass by one another, for there was no avoidance: and the lord gave Ywain greeting and would have stayed him, but Ywain muttered somewhat and so passed on, and Aithne and Dennis with him. And in truth this was Sir Rainald, that was ever busy against other, and more especially against the Eagles: and when he saw Ywain, though he saw not his face, yet he misdoubted him who he was. And Ywain looked after him as he went, and he saw how he stood staring upon the footprints in the snow: and when he had considered them he followed them backwardly, that he might find the house from whence they had set forth.</p>

<p>Then Ywain turned him to Dennis, and he said: What now? for we must make short work. And Dennis stayed not, but ran quickly towards the great Hall, and Ywain and Aithne followed after him. And with a key Dennis opened the door of the Hall, and they three entered in: and there was no man within, but upon the wall was a great horn hanging, and Dennis took down the horn from the wall and gave it into Ywain’s hand.</p>

<p>But Ywain said: How shall I blow for war that know but the hunter’s notes? For belike you have another manner for war, or else you are agreed among yourselves.</p>

<p>And Dennis answered him: Not so, but the sounding of the horn is enough, and no matter the music. For this is an ancient horn and a magical, and there is none among us that is able to sound it, save Hubert only: but it may be that you also are able, for there was a power upon you from the beginning.</p>

<p>Then Ywain went forth and stood before the door, and looked out over the city, and he saw it as a town of faery, for it was new and soft with snow. And he set the horn to his mouth, and blew therein with all his strength, and the note that he sounded was a mort royal: for he said within himself: God willing, we have hunted an evil thing to death. And the sound of the horn blared out and went wide upon the air, and it came loudly into all the quarters of the city and into every street and every house, and there was no man in Paladore that heard it not. And they which heard it were awoke out of sleep, and the most of them groaned and turned them to their sleep again: but upon others came fear and hatred, and they got them quickly to their armour. And the Eagles also heard it and were glad, and they did on their swords which they kept in hiding, and issued forth to go upon their enemies.</p>

<p>But Ywain stood upon the head of the steps that were before the Hall, and he looked out over the city and saw no man stirring, nor he heard no sound of feet. And fear came upon him and loneliness and he thought upon Aithne and said to her: O my beloved, I have brought you to your death. And she answered him proudly: Nay, not yet: for you have sounded but once, and there are many faithful.</p>

<p>Then Ywain took the horn and blew it the second time; and all they which were his began to run towards the place where he was, and they ran quickly, as men that thought not on danger, for joy that the time was come. And Ywain saw them how they came running, and his heart was uplifted with their joy and their fellowship, and his blood within him became like wine. And he set the horn to his mouth and blew it yet a third time, louder than before, and the sound of it smote the walls of Paladore, and the gates and the towers and the houses great and little, and all the whole city rang therewith, and the air trembled and the sky was filled with echoes.</p>

<p>Then the desire of battle came upon the Eagles and they ran together to Ywain and thronged upon the steps before him: and they lifted up their swords and shouted as it were one man, and the noise of their shouting went up mightily and was mingled with the echoes of the horn.</p>
