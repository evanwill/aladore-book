*Aladore* is a classic fantasy novel by Henry Newbolt, first published in 1914.

Despite being republished in the 1970's and 80's in "forgotten fantasy" paperbacks, Aladore is not well known or popular.
The book is now in the public domain and there are a few digitized copies available for free download from repositories such as [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/aladoren00newbuoft/page/n7).
However, these are all PDFs of scanned materials with poor quality OCR.
The out-of-date PDF and automatically generated e-book formats do not provide a satisfactory reading experience on many devices.

`aladore-book` is a web based digital edition of *Aladore* with text derived from the [Digital Aladore](https://digitalaladore.wordpress.com/) project (2014).

Digital Aladore's text is based on two digitized print editions: 

- Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons (1914)
- New York: E.P. Dutton & Company (1915)

Page images of both editions were OCRed using [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract). 
The digital transcripts were collated and edited for accuracy.

This text is also freely available as an [epub edition](https://archive.org/details/AladoreHenryNewbolt3).
