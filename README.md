# aladore-book

A digital edition of Henry Newbolt's classic fantasy novel Aladore (1914).
Based on the text from the [Digital Aladore](https://digitalaladore.wordpress.com/) project.

Digital Aladore is derived from two digitized print editions, Edinburgh: William Blackwood and Sons (1914), and New York: E.P. Dutton & Company (1915).
Page images of both editions were OCRed using Tesseract. 
The digital transcripts were collated and edited for accuracy.
Also available as an [epub edition](https://archive.org/details/AladoreHenryNewbolt3).
